spoiler: No one cares what OS you use more than Linux booters

Right now, the trend of migrating to Linux is so high. I can see it coming after LLMs became super useful. No more 1000 pages to install Arch. I really love it. For developers who live in the terminal for 10 hours per day, I don't want to spend that time watching WSL cry about compatibility. File watching never works right in WSL. Randomly using 4GB of RAM while doing nothing? File access between Windows and WSL has the speed of a grandma walking to the store with her cane.

Unless you're using c#/cpp, doing game dev or LLM research, it's practical to stick with Windows. I still jealous how good c family debugger that Windows got. On the other hand, Linux folks sometimes claim Mac user == Soy Dev. That makes me have a question.

# Why do Linux users always care about what other people use?

I have the same feeling too. When I knew the power of nvim, how to act cool while opening the terminal and running `brew update && brew upgrade` before walking to get my coffee. The flex that grew on my skin. Someone would remove their internet connection after seeing my screen. Yeah, no one cares about it more than myself.
I'm just a big fan of myself.

But if you are a Mac user, the key point of bad stuff is just the window manager. But you can fix it by using some good i3-style window manager, like [aerospace](https://nikitabobko.github.io/AeroSpace/guide), and that's the trade-off for power consumption. But man, if your setup is just a one-screen guy, it's a must.
And then you have nothing to worry about anymore. Seriously, no need to worry. No time consumed on what you're not interested in about building your environment from scratch, and no need to worry when it will break. Or hopping to another distro if things just get messed up.

## Mac, the good part
Your defaults are good. Correct color on screen. I still use macOS Ventura and have nothing to worry about. But what I don't like is just one thing.

## Mac, the bad part
It's not about using my Mac right now. It's just about what's next for my current Mac. Soon or later, my MacBook is gonna be out of support. If it cannot run some Linux, what can I do with it? That's the point where I hope Asahi Linux can succeed in their goal. But the previous drama about Rust in the kernel is making some stuff misty. And support looks so limited. If someone has passion for this work, please join them. [asahi-linux](https://asahilinux.org/contribute/)
What I hope is that after the next 5 years, when my Mac is gonna be out of support, I can run it with a widely used Linux distro, even just for fun.

> Key takeaway: No one cares what OS you use more than Linux booters

For me, Sometime eat what i need better than eat what i want.
